# Pong

This is the classic game of Pong, created using the Unity game engine. I created it as a way to learn the basics of game development with Unity.

## Controls

The game supports split keyboard play, with one player using the W and S keys, and the other player using the up and down arrow keys.

## Features

- Sound effects and [background music](https://uppbeat.io/t/hartzmann/easy-arcade).
- Ball steadily accelerates until a goal is scored.
